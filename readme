Robotics Project developed by Felipe Rasinhas and Jonathan Carvalhosa.

The main objective of this project is to manipulate a robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom using a computer keyboard and an arduino uno board.

The project consists in a cpp listener file that simply receives data, validates it and generates commands to the robotic arm, a shell script that is responsible for establishing the communication of the computer and the arduino board, and an arduino project that receives the control messages via serial port and send it to the robotic arm motors.

Hardware not included =).
